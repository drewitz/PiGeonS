**P**olygons as f**i**nite **geo**desically right-a**n**gled **s**equences

This is an implementation of the algorithm described in [On right-angled polygons in hyperbolic space, E. Dotti, S. Drewitz, Geom Dedicata (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10711-018-0357-y).

It uses the [GluCat library](https://github.com/penguian/glucat).
